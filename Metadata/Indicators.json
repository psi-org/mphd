            "description": "Pregnant women: This indicator captures the reach of interventions that are targeted towards women during pregnancy and intended to contribute to the health of both the mother and the child and to positive birth outcomes. A separate standard indicator will count the number of children under two reached by MOMENTUM-supported programs (HL.9-2: Number of children under two (0-23 months) reached with community-level nutrition interventions through MOMENTUM-supported programs).\n \n7\n          Nutrition-specific interventions: A pregnant woman can be counted as reached if she receives one or more of the following interventions:\n1. Iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation\n2. Individual or small group counseling on maternal and/or child nutrition\n3. Calcium supplementation\n4. Multiple micronutrient supplementation\n5. Direct food assistance of fortified/specialized food products (i.e. CSB+, Supercereal Plus, etc.)\nWomen reached:\nNutrition interventions for women are often delivered at the facility level, included in the package of antenatal care (ANC), but they may also be delivered through community-level platforms, such as care groups or community health extension activities. IFA supplementation is a commonly implemented intervention for pregnant women, often with broad coverage. Ideally, however, pregnant women should receive nutrition interventions beyond IFA, within a comprehensive ANC program informed by the local epidemiology of nutrient deficiencies. A woman is reached with IFA if she receives the IFA according to national guidelines regardless of the number of days she adheres. If a woman only receives iron or only folic acid, she would not be counted as reached.\nIf the IP contributes to \u201csupply\u201d side activities (e.g. procuring the commodity), then the women reached through these interventions can be counted as reached. If the activities, however, only contribute to \u201cdemand\u201d creation (e.g. social and behavior change (SBC) messaging), then they should not be counted under this indicator.\nThe nutrition interventions during pregnancy listed above affect neonatal health outcomes such as low birth weight, small for gestational age, preterm birth, and other negative birth outcomes. Nevertheless, pregnant women reached by these interventions should be counted under this indicator and not counted as a \u201cchild reached\u201d under the two other nutrition PPR indicators: (1) HL.9-1: Number of children under five (0-59 months) reached with nutrition-specific interventions through MOMENTUM-supported programs; (2) HL.9-2: Number of children under two (0-23 months) reached with community-level nutrition interventions through MOMENTUM-supported programs.\nDouble counting across disaggregates: Women can be double counted across the intervention disaggregates if they receive more than one intervention, but a unique number of women reached must be entered into the age disaggregates. The age disaggregates must sum to the total number of pregnant women reached. In order to avoid double counting across interventions, the implementing partner (IP) should follow a two-step process:\n       8\n\n    \n1. First, count each pregnant woman by the type of intervention. For example, a woman who receives IFA and who also receives nutrition counseling should be counted twice, once under each intervention;\n2. Second, eliminate double counting when estimating the total number of pregnant women reached and to disaggregate by age group. The IP should estimate the overlap between the different types of interventions. For example, if 100 women receive comprehensive facility-based ANC and 20 of those women are also participants in a community-based nutrition SBC program, the total number of pregnant women reported in aggregate is only 100, not 120.\nTo avoid double counting across all MOMENTUM funded activities, the Mission should estimate the overlap between the different activities before reporting the aggregate number in the PPR.\nThere are three nutrition standard indicators (HL 9.1, HL 9.2, HL 9.3) that seek to measure children, pregnant women, and/or caretakers reached, as well as the types of interventions received. These indicators measure various age groups and interventions in the critical 1,000 day period of life from pregnancy to age two, as well as key interventions reaching children under five years of age. There is some degree of overlap in individuals reached across these indicators. IPs are allowed to double count children and mothers/caretakers reached across these PPR indicators since they seek to measure different underlying constructs.",
